# OpticOdds API Documentation - LLM Processed

This directory contains API documentation for OpticOdds that has been processed and cleaned using Large Language Models (LLMs) to make it more digestible and usable for AI applications.

## Purpose

The official OpticOdds API documentation comes in HTML format with extensive website boilerplate, navigation elements, JavaScript, CSS, and other web-specific content that makes it difficult for LLMs to process and extract meaningful API information. This processed version removes all the unnecessary markup and presents the essential API documentation in clean, structured markdown format.

## What Was Processed

- **Source**: 47 HTML files from the official OpticOdds API documentation
- **Processing Method**: Automated extraction using LLM batch processing
- **Output Format**: Clean markdown (.md) files with structured API documentation
