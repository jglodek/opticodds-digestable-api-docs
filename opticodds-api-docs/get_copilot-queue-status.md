I notice that you want me to format API documentation, but you haven't provided the actual API documentation content to format. You've mentioned some programming languages (Shell, Node, Ruby, PHP, Python) and a "Try It!" button, which suggests you may be looking at an API documentation page, but I don't see the actual documentation content.

To properly format the API documentation in clean, structured markdown format while keeping everything verbose and including all technical details, I would need you to provide:

1. **The actual API documentation content** - This could include:
   - Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods
   - Request parameters (path, query, body)
   - Request headers
   - Authentication requirements
   - Response formats and status codes
   - Error handling information
   - Code examples in various languages
   - Rate limiting information
   - Any other technical specifications

2. **The specific API details** such as:
   - API name and version
   - Base URL
   - Authentication methods
   - Supported content types
   - Response schemas

Could you please share the API documentation content that you'd like me to format? You can:
- Copy and paste the text from the documentation page
- Share the raw documentation content
- Provide a screenshot if the content is visual
- Share any structured data (JSON, YAML, etc.) that describes the API

Once you provide the actual documentation content, I'll format it into a comprehensive, verbose markdown structure that includes all technical details while removing any website wrapper content.
