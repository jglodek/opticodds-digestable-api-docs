I'd be happy to format your API documentation in clean, structured markdown format while keeping all the verbose technical details. However, I notice that you've referenced "ShellNodeRubyPHPPython" and "Try It!" but haven't provided the actual API documentation content that needs to be formatted.

Could you please provide the raw API documentation content that you'd like me to format? This might include:

- API endpoint URLs and methods
- Request/response parameters
- Authentication details
- Error codes and messages
- Example requests and responses
- Rate limiting information
- Any other technical specifications

Once you share the documentation content, I'll format it into a comprehensive, well-structured markdown document that includes:

## Complete API Documentation Structure

```markdown
# API Name/Title
## Overview
## Base URL
## Authentication
## Endpoints
### Endpoint Name
#### HTTP Method and URL
#### Description
#### Request Parameters
#### Request Headers
#### Request Body Schema
#### Response Format
#### Response Status Codes
#### Error Handling
#### Code Examples (Shell, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, Python)
#### Rate Limits
#### Additional Notes
```

Please share the raw documentation content, and I'll transform it into a verbose, detailed markdown format while preserving all technical information.
