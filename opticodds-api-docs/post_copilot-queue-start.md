I notice you've requested me to format API documentation, but I don't see any actual API documentation content in your message. You've included what appears to be a code snippet or interface element showing:

```
ShellNodeRubyPHPPython
Try It!
```

This looks like it might be part of an API documentation interface with language tabs for different programming languages (Shell, Node, Ruby, PHP, Python) and a "Try It!" button, but there's no actual API documentation content for me to format.

To help you format comprehensive API documentation in clean, structured markdown format while preserving all technical details, I would need you to provide:

1. **The actual API documentation content** - including endpoints, methods, parameters, responses, etc.
2. **Request/response examples** for each programming language
3. **Authentication details**
4. **Error handling information**
5. **Rate limiting information**
6. **Any additional technical specifications**

Could you please share the complete API documentation content that you'd like me to format? Once you provide the raw documentation text or content, I'll create a comprehensive, verbose markdown-formatted version that includes:

- Detailed endpoint descriptions
- Complete parameter listings with types and constraints
- Full request/response examples
- Error code explanations
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting details
- All technical specifications and implementation notes

Please paste the API documentation content you'd like formatted, and I'll transform it into a well-structured, detailed markdown document.
