I notice that you've asked me to format API documentation and keep everything verbose, but I don't see any actual API documentation content in your message to format. 

You've included what appears to be a navigation menu or code sample selector with options like "Shell", "Node", "Ruby", "PHP", "Python" and a "Try It!" button, but there's no actual API documentation content provided for me to format.

To help you format your API documentation properly, I would need you to provide:

1. **The actual API documentation content** - This would typically include:
   - Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods
   - Request parameters and their descriptions
   - Request body schemas
   - Response schemas and examples
   - Authentication requirements
   - Error codes and messages
   - Rate limiting information
   - Any other technical specifications

2. **The source format** - Whether it's coming from:
   - Raw text
   - HTML content
   - JSON/YAML specification files
   - Existing documentation that needs reformatting

Could you please provide the actual API documentation content that you'd like me to format? Once you share that content, I'll be happy to:

- Structure it in clean, comprehensive markdown format
- Maintain all technical details and verbose descriptions
- Organize it with proper headers, code blocks, and formatting
- Include all parameters, examples, and specifications
- Present it in a professional, easy-to-read format while preserving all the detailed information

Please paste the API documentation content you'd like formatted, and I'll transform it into well-structured markdown documentation for you.
