I'd be happy to help you format API documentation in clean, structured markdown format! However, I don't see any API documentation content in your message that needs formatting.

Could you please provide the API documentation content that you'd like me to format? This could include:

- Raw API documentation text
- Endpoint descriptions
- Parameter specifications
- Response schemas
- Code examples
- Authentication details
- Error handling information

Once you share the API documentation content, I'll format it into a comprehensive, verbose markdown structure that includes:

## Complete API Documentation Structure

### Endpoint Information
- **Method and URL**
- **Detailed Description**
- **Authentication Requirements**

### Request Specifications
- **Headers** (with all possible values and descriptions)
- **Path Parameters** (with data types, constraints, and examples)
- **Query Parameters** (with detailed explanations of each parameter)
- **Request Body** (with full schema definitions and examples)

### Response Documentation
- **Success Responses** (with complete schema definitions)
- **Error Responses** (with all possible error codes and descriptions)
- **Response Headers** (if applicable)

### Code Examples
- **Request Examples** in multiple programming languages
- **Response Examples** with full JSON structures
- **Error Handling Examples**

### Additional Technical Details
- **Rate Limiting Information**
- **Versioning Details**
- **Deprecation Notices**
- **Usage Notes and Best Practices**

Please paste the API documentation content you'd like formatted, and I'll transform it into a comprehensive, detailed markdown format while preserving all technical information.
